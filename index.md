# Student Alcohol Consumption Data Visualization

### Here we compile the student alcohol comsumption data from [Student Alcohol Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption).

Team Members:

# Datasets:
For this project we will all be majorly looking at the Portugal Student Alcohol Consumption dataset linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-por.csv). This data set takes in information from a portugese secondary school, where math and Portugese classes were taught. 
# Information being Explored:
 With this, we are going to be investigating many different ideas.  We will be investigating student-homelife impacts, socioeconomic status and gender, course motivation, the European Alcohol consumption per capita by time, and also academic contributions in correlation with alcohol.
