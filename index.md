# **Welcome to Student Alcohol Consumption Data Visualization Page**

Team Members:
* [Bella Yang](bella): I will focus on two questions. First, what does the overview of alcohol purchases worldwide looks like with an in-depth analysis of the regions with the highest alcohol consumption? Second, do some potential factors have a specific relationship with alcohol purchases? There is a positive correlation between alcohol purchases and GDP; There is a negative correlation with the legal drinking age. And in terms of gender and alcohol purchases, men will buy more than women.
* [Max Harvey](Max): I will be investigating student motivation and family life and its relationship to alcohol.
* [Ethan Berman](ethan): I will be investigating the effects alcohol has on student outcomes, and how this varies around the world.

## Alcohol Consumption Datasets:

### Student Alcohol Consumption:

For this project we will all be majorly looking at the Portugal Student Alcohol Consumption dataset linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-por.csv). The data was obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in Portugal secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. There are 33 columns which include school name, sex, age, parents and family information and school performance status. Our goal was to look through the data and analyze the different outcomes and relationships that alcohol might have to students and their drinking habits

## Information being Explored:
 With this, we are going to be investigating many different ideas.  We will be investigating student-homelife impacts, socioeconomic status and gender, course motivation, the European Alcohol consumption per capita by time, and also academic contributions in correlation with alcohol.
