## Project: 

I am interested in the per capita consumption of alcohol for 15+ people in the world. Our data was collected of the consumption of 15-22 year-old students in two secondary schools in Portugal. I feel that the legal drinking age in Europe is relatively low, so I want to see which countries in the world have higher per capita consumption of alcohol.


## Visualization:

Here is a plotly visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by country 2018.

This visualization from [CACTC](https://www.cortlandareactc.org/post/teen-drinking-in-europe-vs-the-united-states#:~:text=While%20only%20about%2033%20out,days%20in%20Denmark%20and%20Austria.) shows that teen drinking rate in Europe Vs. the United States in past 30 days of April, 2020.

Compared to European countries, the US had the lowest teen drinking rate of all, except Iceland, within in the past 30 days. While only about 33% had at least one drink within the past 30 days in the U.S, European rates ranged from 42% teens drinking within the past 30 days in Norway and 80% teens having at least one drink in the past 30 days in Denmark and Austria.   

In most European country, the legal drinking age is between 16-18. Iceland is the only one that has legal drinking age of 20. It is also the only European country with lowest teen drinking rate.
