## Statement of interest

Drinking is a controversial issue. Drinking in moderation is good for your health, but excessive drinking can harm your health. I grew up in China, and the legal age for buying alcohol in China is 18 years old, but many young people younger than 18 have tried to tart drinking. Few places will check ID.

When I came to the United States, I felt that the United States attaches great importance to the legal drinking age. Whether in restaurants or supermarkets, the date of birth on the ID will be carefully checked, which is a good way to control drinking.

My boyfriend’s uncle is a very alcoholic person, which has also become the reason for his death. He often gets drunk with friends and has headaches and vomiting symptoms. But he has no way to change his behavior because he has never been very drunk. He started drinking at a young age. Until one time, he drank too much, causing sudden alcoholism. In the end, the rescue failed and died. I believe that there are many cases of alcohol causing illness or death every year.

The event that happened around me makes me interested in the amount of alcohol purchased in the world. I will focus on the overview of the alcohol consumption situation of the world and the European region. Additionally, the relationship between the average alcohol purchase in the country and some potential variables, like the legal drinking age, national GDP per capita, and gender. Finally, I will do the reseach on how the world's death rate due to alcohol looks like.

## Datasets
I use 5 different Datasets for my investigation: 

[**Recorded alcohol per capita consumption, from 2010**](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1039?lang=en)

The data recorded alcohol per capita consumption from 2010 to 2018. It contains alcohol per capita consumption in liters by countries and detailed information about each beverage type.  

* Here I compile the European region alcohol consumption by country data from the [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main-euro.A1022?lang=en&showonly=GISAH)
The data recorded alcohol per capita consimption from 1960-1979, 1980-1999, 2000-2009, and after 2010. It caontains the column of alcohol per capita consumption in litters by European countries abd each beverage types. 

## Challenges with WHO Data

There are several challenges to overcome when working with his data. I summarize them here.

* In the world alcohol consumption data, there are only the full name of Country in the Country column. When we use plotly to create the Mapbox Choropleth Maps, it maps the graph using Alpha-3 code. I need to merge the data with a list of country codes by Alpha-3 code and make sure all countries in the origin dataset shoule be there after merging. 

* In the WHO wibside, the dataset from 1960-2018 are separated in to 4 individual csv file, 1960-1979, 1980-1999, 2000-2009, and after 2010. I must merge them in to one dataframe and then do the visualization.

* When I did merging, how of parameter only has 'left', 'right', 'outer', 'inner', and 'cross'. Thoes cannot satisefy my merging requriment, so finally I use pd.concat to combine these data. And I also transpose data frame without index, since the column of original data is year and row of original data is countries. It will be easier to make visualization after swap rows and columns. It took me a long time to fix. 

## Alcohol Consumption Visualization

### World alcohol consumption

Here is a plotly visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by country 2018.
{% include_relative Visualization/alcoholc.html %}

As the graph shows, the average per capita alcohol consumption varies widely across the world. 
There are big geographical differences: Alcohol consumption across North Africa and the Middle East is particularly low — in many countries like Pakistan and Syrian Arab Republic, close to zero. At the upper end of the scale, alcohol intake across Europe is highest at around 15 liters per person per year in the Czechia, Lithuania, and Latvia. 

Only slightly behind the Eastern European countries are Western European countries – including Germany, France, Portugal, Ireland, and Belgiumm – at around 12 to 13 liters. Outside of Europe the only other countries in this category are Nigeria and Burkina Faso.

Thoughout much of Europe, the legal drinking age is pretty low and ranges between 15 to 18, and often there isn't a legal drinking age at all. This makes their citizen starting to drink at teen. 

### European country alcohol consumption

Here is a line graph visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by European country from 2000 to 2018. 
{% include_relative Visualization/europe.html %}

We can know that the range of alcohol consumption in Europe is pretty large. Like Norway, iceland, and Sweden has lower alcohol consuption, which mathches with the reseach I did. 

### Time series of Eruopean regrion alcohol consumption 

The time series line graph shows the alcohol consumption changes over time. 
{% include_relative Visualization/time.html %}

From 2000 to 2018, the total alcohol consumption started decreasing from 2007. I really interested in what happened in 2007 that makes their alcohol consumption start decreasing. 

### Alcohol consumption vs. GDP per capita

### Alcohol consumption of male vs. female

## Other research

This visualization from [CACTC](https://www.cortlandareactc.org/post/teen-drinking-in-europe-vs-the-united-states#:~:text=While%20only%20about%2033%20out,days%20in%20Denmark%20and%20Austria.) shows that teen drinking rate in Europe Vs. the United States in past 30 days of April, 2020.

Compared to European countries, the US had the lowest teen drinking rate of all, except Iceland, within in the past 30 days. While only about 33% had at least one drink within the past 30 days in the U.S, European rates ranged from 42% teens drinking within the past 30 days in Norway and 80% teens having at least one drink in the past 30 days in Denmark and Austria.   

In most European country, the legal drinking age is between 16-18. Iceland is the only one that has legal drinking age of 20. It is also the only European country with lowest teen drinking rate.
