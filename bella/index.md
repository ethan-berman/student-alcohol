## Project: 

I am interested in the per capita consumption of alcohol for 15+ people in the world. Our data was collected of the consumption of 15-22 year-old students in two secondary schools in Portugal. I feel that the legal drinking age in Europe is relatively low, so I want to see which countries in the world have higher per capita consumption of alcohol.

## Dataset:
* Here I compile the world alcohol comsumption by country data from the [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1039?lang=en)
The data recoreded alcohol per capita consumption from 2010 to 2018. It contains alcohol per capita consumption in litters by countries and each beverage types. 

*Here I compile the European region alcohol comsumption by country data from the [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main-euro.A1022?lang=en&showonly=GISAH)
The data recorded alcohol per capita consimption from 1960-1979, 1980-1999, 2000-2009, and after 2010. It caontains the column of alcohol per capita consumption in litters by European countries abd each beverage types. 

## Visualization:

### World alcohol consumption.

Here is a plotly visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by country 2018.

### European Country alcohol consumption.

Here is a line graph visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by European country from 2000 to 2018.

This visualization from [CACTC](https://www.cortlandareactc.org/post/teen-drinking-in-europe-vs-the-united-states#:~:text=While%20only%20about%2033%20out,days%20in%20Denmark%20and%20Austria.) shows that teen drinking rate in Europe Vs. the United States in past 30 days of April, 2020.

Compared to European countries, the US had the lowest teen drinking rate of all, except Iceland, within in the past 30 days. While only about 33% had at least one drink within the past 30 days in the U.S, European rates ranged from 42% teens drinking within the past 30 days in Norway and 80% teens having at least one drink in the past 30 days in Denmark and Austria.   

In most European country, the legal drinking age is between 16-18. Iceland is the only one that has legal drinking age of 20. It is also the only European country with lowest teen drinking rate.
