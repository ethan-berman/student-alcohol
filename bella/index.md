## Project: 

I am interested in the per capita consumption of alcohol for 15+ people in the world. Our data was collected of the consumption of 15-22 year-old students in two secondary schools in Portugal. I feel that the legal drinking age in Europe is relatively early, so I want to see which countries in the world have higher per capita consumption of alcohol.


## Visualization:

Here is a plotly visualization for alcohol, total per capita(15+) consumption by country 2018.
