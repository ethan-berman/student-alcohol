I am interested in examining the role of drinking and academic and family life influence in college. To start the examinations I am going to use a student-alcohol consumption dataset that took place in [Portugal](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-por.csv). My first major investigation is going to look into the correlations between drinking and family home-life.
