### Project:
I am interested in looking at how family dynamics impact student alcohol consumption.  Our dataset has information about the family, including the education and job experience of both parents.
### Visualization:
This histogram compares the relative weekly alcohol consumption of students whose parents live together and apart.

### Other Research
This visualization from [Marripedia](http://marripedia.org/effects.of.divorce.on.children.s.behavior) shows that children whose parents are separated have higher behavioral problem scores.
